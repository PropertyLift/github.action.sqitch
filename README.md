# This is a template readme

Replace the content of this readme with information on your project such as:

- the purpose of the codebase
- instructions on how to use
- links for further reference

Be as detailed as needed, and its useful to pretend you're writing this for yourself to remember in 6 months time.

Remember to update .github/settings.yml with sensible parameters for your project. You will need to change (at a miniumum) and parameter with a `# replace` comment.
